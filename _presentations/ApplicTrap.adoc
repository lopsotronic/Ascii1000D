== The Story

"Duplication is always less expensive than bad abstraction"

image:Abstraction.png[]

=== Product

BigCorp makes a new product, SUPERPLANE. It will have three variants: A, B, and C. 

image:PlaneVariants.png[width=800]

=== Publications planning

The SUPERPLANE publications department opts to use CCS techniques. 

They create a "chunking" strategy based on SUPERPLANE's requirements. 

Each chunk or task can support multiple variants via conditional content (applicability), so the HANDBOOK SUPERPLANE A uses the same tasks as HANDBOOK SUPERPLANE B.

For example, one set of tasks is for the Wing System, and another set of tasks is for the Fuel System.

=== Things go well

The tasks are produced and revisioned independent of the product variants. 

Writers use conditions to specialize each of the tasks for the variant.

Efficiency is gained. Automated builds mean that each Product variant has the latest version of the documentation.

=== SUPERPLANE D Introduction

image:PlaneVariants2.png[width=800]

Hmm

Can you spot anything . . _different_?

=== D Variant Impact on Publications

It's determined that SUPERPLANE D will also function as a car. 

The Wing and Fuel systems will now be WingFuel System. 

There are new systems to support ground travel.

*SUPERPLANE D is the new baseline*

but . . 

*SUPERPLANE B has Systems that do not work on SUPERPLANE D!*

=== Impact Continued II

WingFuel System tasks are created - but new files don't share change history with separate Wing and Fuel.

The history of Wing and Fuel tasks is lost for SuperPlane D.

This will cause problems with the FAR/FAA TC (type certification) process.

=== Impact Continued III

image:GreatScott.png[]

=== {empty}

Conditional Directives for SUPERPLANE B can't support SUPERPLANE D as the "new baseline". This causes publishing failures and content failures - the Grandfather Paradox in action. 

This results in contract problems and airworthiness inspection issues, as our inspection procedures are no longer valid.

=== Impact Continued IV

The conditional overhead in a typical task is now greater than the amount of content that is saved via de-duplication, due to complexity. The gains we sought have been eliminated.


=== {empty}

Add costs of migration, implementation, plus fines, and costs of AOG (aircraft on ground). 

This is the stuff that gets your publications system shut down, your department restructured, your boss fired, or every writer fired and references burnt for all time - basically setting your CV on fire.

Or all of the above.

=== Cleaning Up

AKA, digging ourselves out of this mess

Behind the scenes, SUPERPLANE D is classified as a separate Product - not a variant of SUPERPLANE.

A new "pseudo-variant" SUPERPLANE 0 is created to include the baseline parts from SUPERPLANE D - but NOT the new Systems. 

The deliverable for SUPERPLANE D variant is folded back into SUPERPLANE fold post-processing, as a technical appendix in the deliverable.

=== Litmus Test: Are you in the Applicability Trap?

. Given a product component/system, make a separate task for each variant, add them up.
. Now make one task, but use conditional content for variants.
. *If the single task is longer than the combined tasks, you are in the Applicability Trap*. 

This test can be automated for a codebase fairly easily.

=== Nothing new


These are not new problems. Issues with *display* (style), *addressing* (DMCs), and *modification* (applicability) were predicted as early as 1997 by architects working with transclusion in DynaText, Hytime, and SGML/DSSSL.

LaTeX and CommonMark emphatically rejected transclusion as a design goal due to necessarily domain semantics - precisely what we see with the Applicability Trap. 

=== Conservation of Complexity

image:SoManyConditions.png[width=700]

Variants live in a change system (as forks) or in an applicability model.

The Trap is a side effect from cumulative overhead of conditional logic - it's agnostic of tools/markup.

== Why Did This Happen?

*Many stones to throw here*, but root cause is inherent to CCS/CCMS. CCS replaces:

. *natural language* of unified documents (headings, etc) with
. *constructed language* of a Product/BIS (business information system, generating things like Systems, Variants, etc).

If the BIS is well-architected, all goes well. 

If the BIS *isn't* . . then a CCS deliverable is meaningless.

== Lessons Learned: New Products

CCS / CCMS techniques poor fit for product at Design or Prototype maturity without extremely active Maintainability, Logistics, and Support. 

What're your options?

[transition="zoom"]
=== Unified Formats

Use unified (non-CCS) formats for prototype product. 

That means one deliverable per variant. Lots of duplication, but no reliance on Systems, Configuration Management, etc.

image:OldTimes.png[width=300, float=left]


Old-timey, sure. But old-timey works for a reason.

[transition="zoom"]
=== Get Support

If CCS/CCMS is contractually required, Configuration Management and Maintainability must be active players in the CCS "chunking" (DMCs). 

The same groups must also be active in planning Conditions (applic).

=== You Might Not Have Any Support

image:GenInTheRobot.png[width=500]

But you can't force everyone to get on the boat.

[transition="zoom"]
=== Pseudo-Product (S1000D SDC)

If pubs HAS to "go it alone" AND has contractual requirements for CCS, THEN give the tasks their own variant code (S1000D SDC, DISCODEV, INCODEV)

*ISOLATE* until this . . whatever this is . . is mature. 

Then merge back when it's entered FRP (full rate production) - IF it ever shares content with anything else. Which it probably will not - it's unarchitected. 

Also, put the FAA on speed dial, because this is a huge red flag.

== Lessons Learned: New Variants

With mature product, tag overactive "variants" early and *escalate*. 

Use S1000D SDC (or discodev [disassembly code variant] equivalent) liberally for alien, immature, undocumented variants.

Strongly consider unified formats for those "variants" which have 0% commonality with anything else. _Because those aren't variants. Someone's making fibs, for money._

== Inactive Leadership Still Gets You Fired When The Whole Damn Thing Lawn Darts Into An Elementary School

If leadership is inactive, <<Cleaning Up, take action>>. 

Blame flows down regardless, so . .

we might as well fix things.
