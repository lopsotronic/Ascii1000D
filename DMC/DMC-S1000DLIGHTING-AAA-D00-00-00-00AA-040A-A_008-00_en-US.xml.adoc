== Lighting system

The illustration that follows (see
link:#ID_S1000DLIGHTING-AAA-D00-00-00-00AA-040A-A_fig-0001[Lighting
system]) shows the lighting system of the bicycle.

The lighting system is equipped with special high beam lighting. Do not
use special high beam lighting when bicycling on roads during winter
months.

The lighting system is faulty and will be replaced by 2013-03-15.
