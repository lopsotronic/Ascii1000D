== History

Asciidoctor has a number of PDF pipelines for print production. 
The vanilla PDF tool is asciidoctor-pdf, which is built on the Ruby PDF toolkit known as Prawn. 
Since this shares Asciidoctor's Ruby lineage, it's considered the standard for Asciidoctor PDF production. 
The older PDF tool is FOPUB, which uses DocBook-XSL to transform Asciidoc to DocBook and then to PDF. 
FOPUB is packaged with the standalone editor AsciidocFX. 
A tool of similar vintage is DBLTX toolchain, which transforms Asciidoc -> DocBook -> LaTeX, then uses the powerful LaTeX typesetting system to produce PDF. 
The DBLTX toolchain was the official PDF pipeline for the Python implementation of Asciidoc; the Python ecosystem has since moved on to focus on ReStructuredText/Sphinx with the Jupyter Notebook tool. 
The most interesting of these Asciidoc PDF tools is asciidoctor-web-pdf, which takes Asciidoc's HTML output then uses CSS PMM (Paged Media Module) and the Paged.js library to produce PDFs from a headless Chromium instance using Puppeteer. 
Web PDF allows the designer to centralize much of the CSS work, and the flexibility of JS as a template language is hard to overstate. 
This is also the default PDF pipeline for the powerful Antora build tool, which is the more-or-less de-facto CMS for Asciidoctor.
