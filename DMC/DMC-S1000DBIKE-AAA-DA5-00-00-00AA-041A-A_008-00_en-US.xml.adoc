== Gears

The gears include the mechanism, the hubs and the shifters.

The description of the mechanisms is given in

The bicycles of these days can have 27 gears or more. The mountain bikes
use a set that includes:

* Three socket sprockets of different dimension on the front
* Nine socket sprockets of different dimensions at the rear

This set gives the gear ratios.

The shifters installed on the handlebars change the gears and operate
the mechanisms (also known as derailleurs). These derailleurs are
cable-actuated mechanisms. They move the chain from the different
sprockets.

The hub is the center of the wheel and contains the axle and bearings.

The gears let the rider crank at the pedals at a constant movement on
slopes of different angles.
