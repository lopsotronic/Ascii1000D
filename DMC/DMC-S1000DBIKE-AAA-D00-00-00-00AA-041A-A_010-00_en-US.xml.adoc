A bicycle (refer to
link:#ID_S1000DBIKE-AAA-D00-00-00-00AA-041A-A_fig-0001[Complete
bicycle]) is a frame and a number of movable components with mechanical
parts that are completely open. There are no covers or sheet metal
panels that prevent access to the mechanical parts. Thus, you can
disassemble the different components of a bicycle (refer to
link:#ID_S1000DBIKE-AAA-D00-00-00-00AA-041A-A_fig-0001-gra-0001-hot-0000[
]) to do:

* an inspection
* a maintenance task
* a repair task
