To remove your bike's front wheel, place the bike on a stand. If you do
not have a stand, you can still remove the tire. It will just take a
little coordination on your part.

Begin by either deflating the front tire slightly or disconnecting the
front brakes. This is done so the wheel can come out easily and not get
stuck at the brake pads.

If your bike has a quick-release lever, push the lever outward and turn
it in a counterclockwise motion for several revolutions.

If your bike does not have a quick-release lever, you will need a wrench
to loosen the nuts on either side of the hub.
