Regular cleaning and testing of your bike's systems are part of keeping
your bike maintained. Over time, your bike's moving parts become
susceptible to dirt and grime and will eventually fail to operate
correctly if they are not maintained. Because the bike has so many
moving parts, it is important that you know how to keep the bike clean
and lubricated.

It is also important to know how to patch an inner tube puncture. As you
are riding, you never know what you might run over. A nail or a tack can
cause quite a bit of aggravation.

Now that you have completed this topic, you should be able to perform
some general maintenance on your bike.
