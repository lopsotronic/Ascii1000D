link:#ID_S1000DBIKE-AAA-DA0-20-00-00AA-520A-A[S1000DBIKE-AAA-DA0-20-00-00AA-520A-A])
. Make sure that there is no air in the tube.
[arabic]
.. Loosen the cap on the valve stem.
.. Push the valve stem core down to bleed all the air.
. Use a link:#ID_S1000DBIKE-AAA-D00-00-00-00AA-663A-A_seq-0001[Tire
lever] to move the tire bead out of its seat. Lift the tire bead above
the lip of the rim.
. Remove the tube.
. Inflate (not fully) the tube with the
link:#ID_S1000DBIKE-AAA-D00-00-00-00AA-663A-A_seq-0002[Foot pump].
Examine the tube for leaks.
. If you find a leak, identify it with a circle made with a

. Release most of the air.
. Use a piece of sandpaper from the
link:#ID_S1000DBIKE-AAA-D00-00-00-00AA-663A-A_seq-0004[Tube patch kit]
and make the area on and around the hole rough. This will help the patch
bond correctly.
